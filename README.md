# micrograd

A neural network library implemented from scratch in Python, as a part of the "Neural Networks - Zero to Hero" course by Andrej Karpathy. This project demonstrates the fundamentals of automatic differentiation and backpropagation, allowing users to build and train simple neural networks. It includes a `Value` class for tracking computations and gradients, and supports basic arithmetic operations and activation functions.
